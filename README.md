# FlipDown

Adapting a count down timer by Peter Butcher to use for an evergreen webinar landing page.

Basic idea is that you determine which days of the week, and hours of the day, you want the countdown to run for, and it'll countdown to those.

So, Monday to Friday from 9am to 5pm, and the top of the hour.

Outside of these days and hours, it'll count down to the next available slot defined.
